        <li>Use the service in a way that could compromise availability, integrity, or confidentiality.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Customer content and responsibilities</h2>

        intellectual property law.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Fees, billing, and suspension</h2>

      </p>

      <h2>10. Third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        TaskHawk may interoperate with third-party tools and infrastructure. We are not responsible for third-party services,

      </p>

      <h2>13. Indemnity</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify us against losses, claims, and costs arising from your unlawful use of TaskHawk,

      <p>
        We may update these Terms periodically. Material changes will be communicated by reasonable means.
        Continued use after the effective date indicates acceptance.
